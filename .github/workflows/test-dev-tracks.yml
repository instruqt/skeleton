# Instruqt Github Actions Workflow
#
# This workflow file and its actions will run a validate/push/test cycle on
# on a directory of instruqt tracks. All the tracks in the directory must
# belong to the same Instruqt team. Tracks tagged with `skip-ci`, `ci-skip`, 
# or `no-ci` will not be included in this workflow.
#
# Only DEV tracks that are not in maintenance mode will be tested. Each DEV
# track should have a corresponding PROD track. The workflow will loop through
# the $TRACK_DIR and test tracks when:
# 
#   * A matching DEV version exists on play.instruqt.com
#   * Dev track is not in maintenance mode
#   * Track does not include any of the skip tags: no-ci, ci-skip, skip-ci
#
# This workflow will run on every pull request to the main/master branch.
# 
# To keep run times efficient put your unused DEV tracks into maintenance mode
# or delete them when you're done!
